  Solido v2 - An EVM / Substrate contract abstraction

  ## Introduction

  Client RPC tooling with Substrate is lacking interop with other pallets, eg EVM compatible pallets. In this use case, a potential improvement is to abstract
  these specific RPC client definitions into an agnostic client API.

  From previous work done by the author with [Solido](https://github.com/decent-bet/solido/), we propose to:

  - Add Ink! Smart Contracts and/or PolkadotJS provider interface
  - Integrate a subset or parts of Rosetta oriented towards client RPC scenarios
  - Add missing wallet and signing interfaces
  - Simplify event subscription using reactive patterns
  - Include support for user interface to smart contracts data binding
